# Object-Oriented Programming in Java

## Introduction

Object-oriented programming (OOP) allows you to extend a program without having to touch previously tested and working code.

## Classes and Objects

* In Java, all code is defined in a class.
* A class describes how to make an object of that class type. A class is like a blueprint.
* An object can take care of itself; you don't have to know or care how the object does it.
* An object knows things and does things.
* Things an object knows about itself are called instance variables. They represent the state of an object.
* Things an object does are called methods. They represent the behavior of an object.

## Test Classes

* When you create a class, you may also want to create a separate test class, which you'll use to create objects of your new class type.

## Inheritance

* A class can inherit instance variables and methods from a more abstract superclass.

## Runtime Behavior

* At runtime, a Java program is nothing more than objects "talking" to other objects.

## Key Takeaways

* OOP allows for extensibility without modifying working code.
* Classes are blueprints for creating objects.
* Objects know things (instance variables) and do things (methods).
* Test classes are used to create objects of new class types.
* Inheritance allows classes to inherit variables and methods from superclass.
* At runtime, Java programs are composed of objects interacting with each other.

## Bullet points

* Object-oriented programming lets you extend
a program without having to touch previouslytested,
working code.
* All Java code is defined in a class.
* A class describes how to make an object of
that class type. A class is like a blueprint.
* An object can take care of itself; you don’t
have to know or care how the object does it.
* An object knows things and does things.
* Things an object knows about itself are called
instance variables. They represent the state
of an object.
* Things an object does are called methods.
They represent the behavior of an object.
* When you create a class, you may also want
to create a separate test class which you’ll
use to create objects of your new class type.
* A class can inherit instance variables and
methods from a more abstract superclass.
* At runtime, a Java program is nothing more
than objects ‘talking’ to other objects.
